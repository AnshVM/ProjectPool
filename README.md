# ProjectPool
Students can make a Facebook clone, an Instagram clone, Blogging websites, to fill their projects section on their resume but is it really fun to create something which is already on the resume of so many students? ProjectPool gives student developers a platform to showcase their exisiting projects and unique project ideas. It also enables students to get unique ideas for their own projects so that they can make an app/website about which they are actually excited about.
